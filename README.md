This repo assumes that you have already installed neovim 0.7.2 and packer.nvim installed.


download this repo and place lua directory and init.lua file in your .config/nvim directory and just give :PackerSync <br>
Enjoy the new config !!

to make it more like vscode one could try to add autocomplete feature to their nvim using a LSP <br>
I haven't added it here as I don't use autocomplete 
https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim this is one of the popular plugins for autocomplete.
